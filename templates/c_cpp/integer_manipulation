8 bit signed integer

First it is worthy of note that the computer gets its values from 2's complement
Possible positive values are from 0000 0001 to 0111 1111
Possible negative values are from 1111 1111 to 1000 0000
- The computers use "two's complement" to store negative integer values
- To change the sign of an integer value, we must reverse all bits and add 1

An integer is a whole number from the latin word integer meaning whole. In the context of computers, integers are whole numbers represented by binary digits

For example, in a positive number reperesented by binary digits, 0 represents a negative value and 1 represents a positive value.

Since in binary form, there are only two numbers 0 and 1, two's complement is how computers store negative numbers.

In binary number, the MSB(most significant bit), that is the bit furthest to the left, is used to indicate whether the number is positive or negative.

MSB is 0 when the number is positive and 
MSB is 1 when the number is negative


A byte is 8 bits. This means a 32 bits system is 4bytes. For example, 65 in 8-bits is 0100 0001 and 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 0001 in 32-bits form. 
To convert a number in decimal to 2's complement, first we must use 1's complement. To convert a digit to 1's complement, first invert every bit. For example, 

Decimal: 10
Binary: 0000 1010
1's Complement: 1111 0101
2's Complement: 1111 0110

The steps are:
Convert the decimal to binary
Find the 1's complement by changing all 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's.
Calculate the 2's complement by adding 1 to the LSB(least Significant bit) of the 1's complement
